# Multi-Scale Pandemic Analysis

## Requirements
 * Python 3
 * NumPy library

## Running

Run the following command:

`python evaluation.py`

## Modification

Add methods to `projections.py`, for alternative ways of constructing `M_b`.
Any method added to that file will automatically be simulated by re-running `python evaluation.py`.
